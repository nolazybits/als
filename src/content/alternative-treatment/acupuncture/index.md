## Science
Acupuncture has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. It is based on Taoist philosophy, which suggests that good health depends on uninterrupted blood circulation through all the organs of the body and that disruption in circulation affects normal physiological function.

In acupuncture therapy, fine, sterile metal needles are inserted under the skin along specially designated points along the body called acupoints. This procedure is touted to stimulate the release of natural painkillers in the human body and affect areas in the brain that process pain.

The most commonly used acupuncture techniques in ALS include scalp and spinal acupuncture where fine needles are inserted alongside the governing vessel, which runs up the spine to the head and over the center of the scalp.

In some cases, needle insertion is accompanied by the application of small electric currents (electroacupuncture) or injection of chemicals (acupuncture injection therapy).[^1]
