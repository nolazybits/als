summary: Masitinib is currently the only tyrosine kinase inhibitor in late-stage development for ALS. Masitinib distinguishes itself from other ALS developmental drugs by exerting neuroprotection in both central and peripheral nervous systems.

## Science
Masitinib is an oral treatment designed to block the activity of multiple cell types — including macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and Schwann cells — involved in the inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes marking ALS. It does so through the activity of proteins called tyrosine kinases.[^1]

> Masitinib in combination with Rilutek (riluzole) slows functional decline of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who have a typical disease progression, according to the final report of AB Science‘s Phase 2/3 clinical trial.
>
> At 11 months of treatment with the combo, the rate of disability progression was reduced by 27%, as compared to a placebo plus Rilutek. In contrast, patients who have a faster disease worsening do not benefit as much from adding masitinib to their treatment.
