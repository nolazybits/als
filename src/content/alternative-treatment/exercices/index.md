## Science

Exercise may have many benefits for ALS patients, including reducing depression and improving strength and stamina. But it must be performed carefully to be beneficial. Patients should work with a physical therapist to determine how best to exercise safely, as well as to ensure that they include stretching, strength-building, and range-of-motion exercises in their routine.

Regular and moderate exercise is better than excessive exercise. It is important for patients to avoid overworking their muscles. Aching muscles after exercise mean that they have been overstressed, and this may actually speed muscle loss. Patients should stop exercising when they get tired, rather than trying to push through the fatigue.[^1]

## Exercise Guildeline
**Aerobic exercise** can increase muscle efficiency and endurance by increasing heart rate, respiratory rate and overall cardiovascular fitness. Aerobic exercise examples are **swimming**, **water walking**, walking, cycling, rowing, ...

Remember to exercise in moderation - exercising to the point of fatigue may actually result in increased muscle weakness.

### Stretching exercises

May help decrease the frequency or intensity of muscle cramping. These should be done daily to prevent pain and stiffness.

### Range of motion exercises (ROM)

Help move the joints through their full range of motion. These should be performed actively, if possible, or passively if muscle weakness limits movement. These should be done daily to prevent pain and stiffness.

### ~~Strengthening exercises~~

**Are not recommended**. Working out with weights will not strengthen those muscles already weakened by ALS and could result in increased muscle weakness.[^2]

> Although previous evidence suggests a potential relationship
between heavily active lifestyles and an increased incidence of
ALS (30, 31, 109), recent studies support that physical activity is
not necessarily a risk factor for ALS (42, 43, 110). There is now a
large body of evidence suggesting physical activity as a potential
therapeutic or even holistic approach for ALS.

### [Strengthening Exercises May Slow Progression Of Als](https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/516)  
> The study found those who did moderate strengthening exercises had a 12-percent slower decrease in function and a 16-percent slower decline in quality of life over the six months than those who did the stretching exercises alone.
