## Science

Curcumin has been shown to produce neuroprotective effects. It’s a compound in turmeric (a member of the ginger family), which is often used in the diet and medicines of Southeast Asia, China, and India.

Curcumin is able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) — a highly selective membrane that shields the central nervous system from general blood circulation — which makes it an ideal therapeutic candidate for diseases of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease.

Theracurmin (nanocurmin) is a more bio aaialable version of normal curcumin supplements.

### Mechanisms:[^1]  
* decrease neuroinflammation
* prevent oxidative stress
* might inhibit protein aggregation
* alter fecal microbiome

#### [2018 - ALS Untangled 44 - Curcumin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2018.1440738)

> Oral curcumin is safe, inexpensive, and has at least four potential mechanisms by which it might theoretically be useful in treating PALS. Flawed preclinical studies showed benefits of a curcumin chemical analog in a cell model of ALS, three PALS experienced validated motor improvements on regimens including curcumin (although there are several alternative explanations for these improvements) and there is one small pilot trial showing some benefit of curcumin in PALS. Based on the evidence presented in this review, some of us are planning a trial of Theracurmin at 90 mg twice daily in PALS.
