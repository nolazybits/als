## Mechanisms
Oxidative stress is believed to play a major role in ALS pathogenesis[^1]. Unfortunately, trials of antioxidants have thus far failed to show any benefits in patients with ALS[^2] [^3]. One explanation for these failures is that the antioxidants did not reach the optimal place. Since mitochondria are both the main producer and main target of oxidative stress, mitochondrial-focused antioxidant therapy might be more successful. Orally administered MitoQ can alter markers of both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in cell culture (10) and animal model of ALS (11).

#### [2015 - Antioxidant MitoQ Shown As A Promising Therapy for ALS](https://alsnewstoday.com/2015/07/16/antioxidant-mitoq-shown-promising-therapy-als/)

> “This study supports the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of ALS, which may allow
> for the development of more mitochondria-targeted therapies to fight this disease,” concluded study’s co-author and
> Director of the Center, Dr. Rafael Radi. “We also found that MitoQ has beneficial effects in the murine model of ALS,
> which will likely lead to clinical trials using MitoQ with ALS patients and hopefully lead to extend the survival and
> improve the quality of life of ALS patients.”

> MitoQ is a mitochondrial antioxidant that contains the antioxidant Quinone linked to a lipophilic
> triphenylphosphonium cation. Researchers showed that MitoQ prolonged life span and the pathology of SOD-knockout Drosophila melanogaster, 
> the enzyme involved in ALS. In addition, the compound has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in SODG93A mice, slowing functional decline,
> decreasing oxidative damage and disease progression, and increasing survival.  
> Furthermore, other studies showed that MitoQ preincubation prevented the cell death observed in cultures of motor 
> neurons + SOD-mutant astrocytes alone.

> MitoQ has a promising mechanism, positive preclinical data from two different ALS models, and appears reasonably safe 
> and inexpensive, especially at doses of 10 mg daily. Available anecdotal data are insufficient to determine how helpful
> this might be in PALS. A small open-label pilot trial with validated ALS diagnoses and outcomes appears warranted.
