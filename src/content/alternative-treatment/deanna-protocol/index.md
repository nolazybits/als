## The story behind the protocol
In 2009, Deanna was a healthy 31-yr-old pregnant newlywed with plenty of energy, an active lifestyle, and a successful career as a trial attorney and a Partner in a Tampa law firm. Her life came to a halt, when she was diagnosed with ALS after she found herself falling and losing balance frequently. She sought help from the most credible physicians and institutions in the country in treating ALS and they all told her the same thing: “There is no cure. There is no effective way to manage the disease. Your disease is progressing quickly and you will be dead in 2 years.” They were right. Within months, she went from walking normally and running several miles a day to walking very slowly with a cane. She was dying…quickly. This is when Deanna’s father Dr. Tedone (MD) took action.  

He began reading all scientific research on ALS in the past 100 years to try to find a solution for Deanna. Based on his medical knowledge and familiarity with ALS research, he began testing safe substances on Deanna and eventually teamed up with scientists at the University of South Florida to test and refine these substances in the lab. This is how the original Deanna Protocol was born. When on the Deanna Protocol, Deanna’s physical condition stopped deteriorating and she stabilized (which is unheard of in ALS patients who are progressing quickly). Deanna was doing so well on the Deanna Protocol that other ALS patients who knew her began asking Dr. Tedone to share information with them on what Deanna was taking. Others with ALS began seeing incredible results and began referring friends and writing about their improvements on ALS related blogs and websites. Word of mouth continued to spread and, now, there are over 6,000 individuals with ALS on the Deanna Protocol worldwide. 

Throughout the years, Dr. Tedone and scientists at different universities have tested and improved upon the Protocol, which has given way to the Deanna Protocol that exists today: a patent pending substance with a proprietary ratio of **Arginine (AAKG)**, **Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid (AKG)**, and **Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)**. These are all substances that are naturally found in the body. However, people with ALS need more of these substances to give fuel to the Krebs Cycle (energy producing cycle) in their nerve cells, in order to keep their diseased nerve cells alive. Think of the Deanna Protocol as special fuel needed to keep the cell’s engine running when the engine is malfunctioning because of a disease.[^1]

> [...] melatonin slowed disease progression by 25% or 73%, depending on the definition of "disease onset", by the appearance of first tremor or failure on the rotarod, respectively.  

> Translating these findings to human ALS, we are aware that a cure by melatonin is unlikely. An increase in life expectancy, however, is a worth-while goal, specifically during the early stages of this disease.
