> In conclusion, there are good theoretical mechanisms for carnitines, some pre-clinical evidence for LC and ALCAR, and a single clinical trial that suggested ALCAR could slow disease progression in PALS. All three carnitines appear to be well-tolerated, generally safe and inexpensive. We believe that there is a need for future clinical trials of carnitines in PALS to further elucidate their efficacy. Until there is further data, we cannot endorse any of these supplements as a definite way to slow ALS progression; **however, oral ALCAR at 1000mg three times daily (3000mg total daily dose) appears to be a theoretically promising supplement available for PALS whom would like to self-experiment**
