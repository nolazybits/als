&lt;p>Acupuncture has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. It is based on Taoist philosophy, which suggests that good health depends on uninterrupted blood circulation through all the organs of the body and that disruption in circulation affects normal physiological function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In acupuncture therapy, fine, sterile metal needles are inserted under the skin along specially designated points along the body called acupoints. This procedure is touted to stimulate the release of natural painkillers in the human body and affect areas in the brain that process pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most commonly used acupuncture techniques in ALS include scalp and spinal acupuncture where fine needles are inserted alongside the governing vessel, which runs up the spine to the head and over the center of the scalp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some cases, needle insertion is accompanied by the application of small electric currents (electroacupuncture) or injection of chemicals (acupuncture injection therapy).&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are no clinical trials currently testing the effects of acupuncture therapy for ALS specifically. Most of the information available about its potential benefits for ALS symptoms is from clinical case studies and Chinese literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although the motor dysfunctions are the main symptoms of ALS, spasticity and associated pain are common, and acupuncture has been shown in studies to be most useful for alleviating these symptoms.
Significant neurologic improvements in 2 patients with ALS after acupuncture injection therapy were reported by Liang et al.
There are other studies showing beneficial effects of acupuncture in ALS, involving motor functions, in Chinese literature that is not referenced in PubMed&lt;br>
One of these is by Cheng Yongde who treated 46 patients who had ALS with acupuncture and Chinese herbs and is detailed in an article by Dharmananda
Six patients had clinical remission; for 11, the treatment was markedly effective; for 24, it was fairly effective; and for 5, it was ineffective&lt;br>
The current case is remarkable in that, after relentless aggravation for 4 months resulting in Grade 2 weakness in both feet—which made climbing stairs impossible and caused considerable difficulty in walking even on level ground 2 months of acupuncture reversed most of this patient’s symptoms—spasm, pain, weakness and fasciculation—and she was able to climb stairs and engage in brisk walking for 2 hours every day. This could be labeled as a placebo effect, spontaneous resolution, or a doctor–patient relationship effect.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>No conclusion can be drawn from a single case; the emphasis here is on the approach to the patient&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Acupuncture is reasonably safe, and has potential mechanisms of action, pre-clinical studies and case reports suggesting that it could be a useful treatment for ALS. However, before it can be endorsed even as a candidate for a phase II trial, the studies described above need to be independently replicated using more clearly verified diagnoses and more rigorous designs, including appropriate controls and validated ALS outcome measures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two patients with ALS were treated with 4 weeks of acupuncture injection therapy using Enercel. These individuals demonstrated significant improvements in speech and muscle strength in the extremities after treatment. The patients were regularly contacted for 3 months after receiving treatment.&lt;br>
Patient #1 did not maintain the Enercel acupoint injection treatments due to restrictions in her home state. She did not receive regular Enercel adminis- trations via oral, sublingual, or intramuscular routes. She demonstrated a slow decline in neurological functioning over the following 3 months, although at the end she her condition was still better than that recorded at baseline.&lt;br>
Patient #2 continued regular Enercel acupoint injection therapy and Enercel use. The clinical improvements he achieved during the 4 weeks of intensive treatment were maintained during the 3-month follow-up period. It appears that persistent acupoint injection therapy with Enercel may be required in order to maintain the initial positive effects.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>However, these findings are preliminary. Additional, formal studies and controlled clinical trials are required to expand and confirm these results.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exercise may have many benefits for ALS patients, including reducing depression and improving strength and stamina. But it must be performed carefully to be beneficial. Patients should work with a physical therapist to determine how best to exercise safely, as well as to ensure that they include stretching, strength-building, and range-of-motion exercises in their routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regular and moderate exercise is better than excessive exercise. It is important for patients to avoid overworking their muscles. Aching muscles after exercise mean that they have been overstressed, and this may actually speed muscle loss. Patients should stop exercising when they get tired, rather than trying to push through the fatigue.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exercise-guildeline">Exercise Guildeline&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aerobic exercise&lt;/strong> can increase muscle efficiency and endurance by increasing heart rate, respiratory rate and overall cardiovascular fitness. Aerobic exercise examples are &lt;strong>swimming&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>water walking&lt;/strong>, walking, cycling, rowing, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember to exercise in moderation - exercising to the point of fatigue may actually result in increased muscle weakness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="stretching-exercises">Stretching exercises&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>May help decrease the frequency or intensity of muscle cramping. These should be done daily to prevent pain and stiffness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="range-of-motion-exercises-rom">Range of motion exercises (ROM)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Help move the joints through their full range of motion. These should be performed actively, if possible, or passively if muscle weakness limits movement. These should be done daily to prevent pain and stiffness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although previous evidence suggests a potential relationship
between heavily active lifestyles and an increased incidence of
ALS (30, 31, 109), recent studies support that physical activity is
not necessarily a risk factor for ALS (42, 43, 110). There is now a
large body of evidence suggesting physical activity as a potential
therapeutic or even holistic approach for ALS.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The study found those who did moderate strengthening exercises had a 12-percent slower decrease in function and a 16-percent slower decline in quality of life over the six months than those who did the stretching exercises alone.&lt;/p>
