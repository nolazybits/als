The story behind the protocol In 2009, Deanna was a healthy 31-yr-old pregnant newlywed with plenty of energy, an active lifestyle, and a successful career as a trial attorney and a Partner in a Tampa law firm. Her life came to a halt, when she was diagnosed with ALS after she found herself falling and losing balance frequently. She sought help from the most credible physicians and institutions in the country in treating ALS and they all told her the same thing: “There is no cure. There is no effective way to manage the disease. Your disease is progressing quickly and you will be dead in 2 years.” They were right. Within months, she went from walking normally and running several miles a day to walking very slowly with a cane. She was dying…quickly. This is when Deanna’s father Dr. Tedone (MD) took action.\nHe began reading all scientific research on ALS in the past 100 years to try to find a solution for Deanna. Based on his medical knowledge and familiarity with ALS research, he began testing safe substances on Deanna and eventually teamed up with scientists at the University of South Florida to test and refine these substances in the lab. This is how the original Deanna Protocol was born. When on the Deanna Protocol, Deanna’s physical condition stopped deteriorating and she stabilized (which is unheard of in ALS patients who are progressing quickly). Deanna was doing so well on the Deanna Protocol that other ALS patients who knew her began asking Dr. Tedone to share information with them on what Deanna was taking. Others with ALS began seeing incredible results and began referring friends and writing about their improvements on ALS related blogs and websites. Word of mouth continued to spread and, now, there are over 6,000 individuals with ALS on the Deanna Protocol worldwide.\nThroughout the years, Dr. Tedone and scientists at different universities have tested and improved upon the Protocol, which has given way to the Deanna Protocol that exists today: a patent pending substance with a proprietary ratio of Arginine (AAKG), Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid (AKG), and Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). These are all substances that are naturally found in the body. However, people with ALS need more of these substances to give fuel to the Krebs Cycle (energy producing cycle) in their nerve cells, in order to keep their diseased nerve cells alive. Think of the Deanna Protocol as special fuel needed to keep the cell’s engine running when the engine is malfunctioning because of a disease.1\nYou can find a lot more information on the official website: https://winningthefight.org/\nThe protocol Supplements Arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG) TODO\nGamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) TODO\nOptional Supplements Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) TODO\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) TODO\nDr Tedone advices  Take AAKG with a ration of 1:1 Arginine to Alpha-Ktoglutarate.\nExample:  Primaforce Simplesa    Borrelia Bacteria  We have a strong body of evidence suggesting that ALS is likely caused by an undiagnosed infection with borrelia bacteria and at times coinfections Deanna and the vast majority of other individuals we have worked with who have ALS have been diagnosed with borrelia infections 2\n Please check this page with test recommendation\nScience  Arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG) Delivers energy to nerves Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) Delivers energy to nerves Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Inhibitory neurotransmitter Nicotinamide Stops nerve cell death  Articles  The titles of the articles are clickable and will redirect you to the online resource.

However, many of the preclinical and animal studies related to these pathways have not translated into successful treatments in patients with ALS. While there are anecdotal reports of improvements in patients with ALS on the Deanna Protocol, there is no convincing objective evidence of benefit yet. Thus, at this time, ALSUntangled does not recommend the Deanna Protocol to patients with ALS.\nBefore it can be recommended, a reproducible version of the Deanna Protocol should be shown to influence plausible physiologic mechanisms such as central nervous system ketone bodies, as well as clinically meaningful outcome measures such as ALSFRS-R and FVC in patients with ALS.\n   from winningthefight.org \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://winningthefight.org/borrelia-bacteria/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1610928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613700300,"objectID":"8e9ba7784deac2ba796beb39e1e059d4","permalink":"/alternative-treatment/deanna-protocol/","publishdate":"2021-01-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/alternative-treatment/deanna-protocol/","section":"alternative-treatment","summary":"Protocol created by Dr Tedone for his daughter Deanna.

Found in all living cells, NAD is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups.

NAD exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form, abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH respectively.1\n[\u0026hellip;]There are three major functions of NAD. First, it allows us to convert our food into ATP, which is the biological chemical currency that allows us to move our muscles, have ideas, and run all of our cells. Second, NAD also catalyzes conversion of the food we eat into everything we are, including DNA, RNA, proteins, hormones and lipids. Third, NAD helps us to repair cellular damage to DNA, protein and fat that is caused by the way we live our lives, what we eat or drink, how we sleep, travel, sun, the air we breath, stress and just plain old wear-and-tear. 2\nWhat are NMN, NA and NR?

Flawed preclinical studies showed benefits of a curcumin chemical analog in a cell model of ALS, three PALS experienced validated motor improvements on regimens including curcumin (although there are several alternative explanations for these improvements) and there is one small pilot trial showing some benefit of curcumin in PALS.
