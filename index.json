There are other studies showing beneficial effects of acupuncture in ALS, involving motor functions, in Chinese literature that is not referenced in PubMed\nOne of these is by Cheng Yongde who treated 46 patients who had ALS with acupuncture and Chinese herbs and is detailed in an article by Dharmananda Six patients had clinical remission; for 11, the treatment was markedly effective; for 24, it was fairly effective; and for 5, it was ineffective\nThe current case is remarkable in that, after relentless aggravation for 4 months resulting in Grade 2 weakness in both feet—which made climbing stairs impossible and caused considerable difficulty in walking even on level ground 2 months of acupuncture reversed most of this patient’s symptoms—spasm, pain, weakness and fasciculation—and she was able to climb stairs and engage in brisk walking for 2 hours every day.

These individuals demonstrated significant improvements in speech and muscle strength in the extremities after treatment. The patients were regularly contacted for 3 months after receiving treatment.\nPatient #1 did not maintain the Enercel acupoint injection treatments due to restrictions in her home state. She did not receive regular Enercel adminis- trations via oral, sublingual, or intramuscular routes. She demonstrated a slow decline in neurological functioning over the following 3 months, although at the end she her condition was still better than that recorded at baseline.\nPatient #2 continued regular Enercel acupoint injection therapy and Enercel use. The clinical improvements he achieved during the 4 weeks of intensive treatment were maintained during the 3-month follow-up period. It appears that persistent acupoint injection therapy with Enercel may be required in order to maintain the initial positive effects.\nHowever, these findings are preliminary.

This makes it more potent than untargeted ubiquinone analogs at protecting cells in culture from oxidative stress\nOxidative stress is believed to play a major role in ALS pathogenesis1. Unfortunately, trials of antioxidants have thus far failed to show any benefits in patients with ALS2 3. One explanation for these failures is that the antioxidants did not reach the optimal place.
