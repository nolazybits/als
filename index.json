Its active ingredient is ubiquinone, as found in coenzyme Q10 and idebenone. However, the ubiquinone in MitoQ is attached to a positively charged, lipophilic molecule called TPP (triphenyl phosphonium), which allows it to selectively accumulate in mitochondria. This makes it more potent than untargeted ubiquinone analogs at protecting cells in culture from oxidative stress\nOxidative stress is believed to play a major role in ALS pathogenesis1. Unfortunately, trials of antioxidants have thus far failed to show any benefits in patients with ALS2 3. One explanation for these failures is that the antioxidants did not reach the optimal place. Since mitochondria are both the main producer and main target of oxidative stress, mitochondrial-focused antioxidant therapy might be more successful. Orally administered MitoQ can alter markers of both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in cell culture4 and animal model of ALS (11).\nArticles  The titles of the articles are clickable and will redirect you to the online resource.

Researchers showed that MitoQ prolonged life span and the pathology of SOD-knockout Drosophila melanogaster, the enzyme involved in ALS. In addition, the compound has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in SODG93A mice, slowing functional decline, decreasing oxidative damage and disease progression, and increasing survival.\nFurthermore, other studies showed that MitoQ preincubation prevented the cell death observed in cultures of motor neurons + SOD-mutant astrocytes alone.\n 2015 - ALS Untangled No. 29: MitoQ Download PDF\n MitoQ has a promising mechanism, positive preclinical data from two different ALS models, and appears reasonably safe and inexpensive, especially at doses of 10 mg daily. Available anecdotal data are insufficient to determine how helpful this might be in PALS.
